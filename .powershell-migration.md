# PowerShell Migration Notes

## Converted Scripts

- `setup.bat` → `setup.ps1`
- `build.bat` → `build.ps1`

## Enhancements in PowerShell Scripts

### Error Handling
- Proper exception handling with try-catch blocks
- Detailed error messages with colored output
- Graceful exit codes and cleanup

### Prerequisites Validation
- Checks for Git, CMake, and SCons availability
- Validates required dependencies before proceeding
- Provides helpful installation instructions

### Enhanced User Experience
- Colored console output (Cyan for status, Green for success, Red for errors)
- Progress indicators and descriptive messages
- Non-interactive mode support for CI/CD

### Build Configuration Options
- Debug/Release build configurations
- Clean build option
- Flexible CMake generator selection
- Architecture specification

### Robustness
- Better path handling
- File existence validation
- Automatic directory creation
- Submodule update handling

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```powershell
.\setup.ps1
.\build.ps1
```

### Advanced Usage
```powershell
# Release build
.\build.ps1 -Configuration Release

# Clean build
.\build.ps1 -Clean

# CI/CD mode (no user interaction)
.\setup.ps1 -NoWait
.\build.ps1 -NoWait -Configuration Release
```

## Execution Policy

If you encounter execution policy issues:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

## Backward Compatibility

The original .bat files are maintained for compatibility, but PowerShell scripts are recommended for new development.
