# How to Run Your Godot 4.4 C++ Project

## ✅ Extension Status
Your C++ extension is **successfully built** and ready:
- ✅ `bin/win64/godot_game.win64.template_debug.dev.x86_64.dll` 
- ✅ Project configured for Godot 4.4
- ✅ Main scene: `scenes/main.tscn`

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. **Get Godot 4.4+**
If you don't have Godot 4.4+ installed:
- Download from: https://godotengine.org/download/
- Choose **Godot 4.4+ (Latest)**
- Extract the executable (it's portable, no installation needed)

### 2. **Open the Project**
1. Launch `Godot_v4.4-stable_win64.exe` (or similar)
2. In the Project Manager, click **"Import"**
3. Navigate to this directory: `C:\Users\apastukhov\source\repos\godot-test`
4. Select `project.godot` and click **"Import & Edit"**

### 3. **Verify Extension Loading**
Once the project opens, check that your C++ extension loaded:
1. Look at the **Output** panel (bottom of screen)
2. You should see: `"Game initialized!"` message
3. If you see errors, check the **Debugger** tab for details

### 4. **Test the Game**
1. In the **FileSystem** dock, navigate to `scenes/main.tscn`
2. Double-click `main.tscn` to open the scene
3. Click the **"Play Scene"** button (▶️) or press `F6`
4. **Test Controls:**
   - **WASD** or **Arrow Keys** to move the player character
   - The white square should move around the screen

## 🎮 What You Should See

### Scene Structure:
```
Main (Node2D) - Game script
└── Player (CharacterBody2D) - Player script
    ├── CollisionShape2D - Physics collision
    ├── Sprite2D - Visual representation (white square)
    └── Camera2D - Follows the player
```

### Expected Behavior:
- White square (player) that responds to keyboard input
- Smooth movement with WASD/Arrow keys
- Camera follows the player
- Console messages about game initialization

## 🔧 Alternative: Command Line Launch

If you have Godot in a specific location, you can launch it directly:
```powershell
# Replace with your actual Godot path
& "C:\path\to\Godot_v4.4-stable_win64.exe" --path . --editor
```

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Loading:
1. Check **Output** panel for error messages
2. Verify DLL exists: `bin/win64/godot_game.win64.template_debug.dev.x86_64.dll`
3. Try rebuilding: `.\build.ps1 -Clean`

### Player Not Moving:
1. Check that Input Map has proper keybindings
2. Verify Player script is attached to CharacterBody2D node
3. Look for error messages in Debugger

### Build Issues:
1. Run `.\build.ps1` to rebuild extension
2. Check SETUP_SUMMARY.md for troubleshooting steps

## 🎯 Next Development Steps

Once the basic project works:
1. **Add Sprites**: Replace white squares with actual game art
2. **Expand Gameplay**: Add enemies, collectibles, levels
3. **Enhance Classes**: Restore full method bindings for GDScript access
4. **Add Features**: Sound, animations, UI elements
